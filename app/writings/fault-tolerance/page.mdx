## Isolation

- Physical and logical independence between components
- Failure containment—prevent cascading failures
- Critical path with minimal dependencies
- Failures remain localized to origin component

```sql
-- auth service down..?, queries still execute

select * from orders where user_id = 123;
```

## Redundancy

- Multiple copies of every critical component
- Isolated replicas across availability zones
- Geographic distribution for regional failure protection
- Eliminate single points of failure

```
primary: us-east-1a | replica1: us-east-1b | replica2: us-east-1c
```

## Static Stability

- Maintain last known good state during failures
- Overprovision capacity for load absorption
- No configuration changes during incidents
- Fail to known safe state

```yaml
# config service fails, use cached configuration

last_known_good: { max_connections: 1000, timeout: 30s }
```

## Architecture Patterns

### Control Plane vs Data Plane

- Control plane: management, billing, configuration
- Data plane: serves traffic, stores data, operates independently
- Unidirectional dependency: data plane never depends on control plane

```
control plane api down → database continues serving queries
```

### Multi-Zone/Multi-Region

- Minimum three availability zones per cluster
- Automatic failover between zones
- Read replicas across multiple regions
- Regional promotion capabilities

```
cluster topology:

primary(us-east) → read_replica(eu-west) → read_replica(ap-south)
```

## Operational Practices

### Continuous Failover Testing

- Weekly production failover exercises
- Proactive issue detection
- Query buffering during transitions
- Failover as standard operation

```bash
# scheduled weekly failover

mysql> set global read_only=1; -- demote primary
mysql> set global read_only=0; -- promote replica
```

### Progressive Delivery

- Deploy to development environments first
- Feature flags enable granular rollout control
- Multi-week validation before production
- Minimize change impact radius

```json
{
  "feature_new_replication": {
    "dev": true,
    "staging": true,
    "prod": false
  }
}
```

### Synchronous Replication

- Commit acknowledgment requires replica confirmation
- Zero data loss during failovers
- All replicas maintain promotion readiness
- MySQL semi-sync, Postgres synchronous commit

```sql
-- mysql semi-sync: require minimum 1 replica acknowledgment

set global rpl_semi_sync_master_wait_for_slave_count = 1;
```

## Failure Handling

### Instance Level

- Immediate replica promotion on primary failure
- Block storage: volume detach/reattach to healthy instances
- Local storage: provision replacements, decommission failed instances

```bash
# ebs volume migration

aws ec2 detach-volume --volume-id vol-dead
aws ec2 attach-volume --volume-id vol-dead --instance-id i-healthy
```

### Zone Level

- Automatic failover to healthy zone replicas
- Query routing transparently redirects traffic
- Zero manual intervention required

```
proxySQL: us-east-1a (failed) → us-east-1b (new primary)

application connection strings remain unchanged
```

### Region Level

- Regional clusters operate independently
- Cross-region failures isolated
- Manual promotion of read-only regions available

```sql
-- promote eu-west read replica to primary

alter system promote standby database to primary;
```
