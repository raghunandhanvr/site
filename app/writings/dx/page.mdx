My perspective on what creates a good developer experience:

## Shipping

- Stop talking, start shipping—just get it out
- We’re only as good as our last release

## Collaboration

- Why waste time in meetings when pair programming gets things done?
- Clear, direct chats beat long email threads

## Intensity

- Think big—actually do it
- If something feels off, say it
- Don’t shy away from tough questions

## Craftsmanship

- Details matter—take full ownership of what you build
- Leave the code cleaner than you found it, but only if you’re working on that part

## Autonomy

- Figure out your role, then own it
- If you’re stuck, ask for help early and move on

## Humility

- It’s fine to be wrong—just learn and move forward
- Confidence is good; arrogance isn’t
- Be open to others’ ideas, even if you’re sure you’re right
