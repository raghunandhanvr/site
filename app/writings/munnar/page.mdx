# Munnar
<BlogViewCounter slug='/writings/munnar' createdAt={new Date('2025-09-27')} />
<TableOfContents />

I've explored most of the mountains in South India. Munnar is simply the best, no question. Munnar is the best.

Still for those who want a true deep forest experience, go to [Gavi](https://www.google.com/search?q=Gavi+Forest). Now, let's talk about Munnar.

Being from a village near Udumalpet, I'm less than 60km from Munnar, so I've spent countless weekends exploring these hills. 

Munnar consists of 4 major road directions from the town:
- One towards **Udumalpet** (my home route)
- One towards **Vattavada** (most popular tourist route)
- One towards **Theni** (Bodi and Kumili in Poppara junction)
- Another towards **Cochin** (fully damaged and nasty as of 2025)

All roads except Cochin are fantastic for travel.

## Vattavada Road (Common tourist spots, the Traffic is always there)

These places are for **families with big crowds**, and this road will be in traffic most of the time until Top Station. Perfect for **first-time visitors** who want the typical Munnar experience.

1. [Boomer uncle tourist spots](https://www.google.com/search?q=Munnar+botanical+garden+elephant+safari) like botanical garden, elephant safari. Just skip them.
2. [Top Station](https://www.google.com/search?q=Top+Station+Munnar) - The highest point, great views but always crowded
3. [Vattavada](https://www.google.com/search?q=Vattavada+Munnar) - Small village with organic farms, less touristy
4. [Dams on the way](https://www.google.com/search?q=Munnar+dams) - Good photo spots, especially during monsoon
5. [Tea estates on the road](https://www.google.com/search?q=Munnar+tea+estates) - Multiple stops for tea tasting

## Theni Road (Mostly Trekking)

I highly recommend this for **trekking enthusiasts**. This route takes you through some of the most **challenging and rewarding treks** in the region.

1. [Chokramudi Trek](https://www.google.com/search?q=Chokramudi+Trek+Munnar) - Moderate difficulty, 3-4 hours, amazing sunrise views
2. [Kollukumalai Trek](https://www.google.com/search?q=Kollukumalai+Trek+Munnar) - Starts at 5am, need to reach before sunrise, but worth it
3. [Mesapulimala Trek](https://www.google.com/search?q=Mesapulimala+Trek+Munnar) - One of the toughest, 6-8 hours, for experienced trekkers
4. [Tea estates on the road](https://www.google.com/search?q=Theni+road+tea+estates+Munnar) - Less crowded than Vattavada route, better for photography

## Udumalpet Road

This is **my home route** - less touristy, more authentic. Perfect for those who want to experience the **real Munnar without the crowds**.

1. [Thoovanam waterfalls Trek](https://www.google.com/search?q=Thoovanam+waterfalls+Trek+Munnar) - 2-3 hours, beautiful waterfall, good for families
2. [Kanthaloor half day visit](https://www.google.com/search?q=Kanthaloor+Munnar) - Apple orchards and spice gardens, unique to this area
3. [Anamudi](https://www.google.com/search?q=Anamudi+Munnar) - South India's highest peak, restricted access but worth the effort
4. [Chinnar forest safari](https://www.google.com/search?q=Chinnar+forest+safari+Munnar) - Wildlife spotting, best during early morning or late evening
5. [Tea estates on the road](https://www.google.com/search?q=Udumalpet+road+tea+estates+Munnar) - Working plantations, not just tourist spots
