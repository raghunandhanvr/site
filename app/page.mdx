I'm a software engineer at [Freightify](https://www.freightify.com/). I'm originally from Udumalpet, Tamil Nadu, India. I've owe much of my career to the Web and Security Research.

I hold a **B.Tech in Information Technology** from [Sri Eshwar College of Engineering](https://sece.ac.in/).

Sometimes, I'm into blockchain and GenAI. I like deploying on **self-hosted bare metal** instead of just cloud infrastructure. Not anti-cloud, but **homelab supremacy** ⌐■_■.

### Technical Contributions

- Developed an **IAM Service** at Freightify using GoLang, MySQL, PHP, and K8s, serving over 100,000 customers daily
- Built a custom **reverse proxy** at Freightify based on [Skipper](https://opensource.zalando.com/skipper/), handling over 1 million daily API requests with fully flexible configurations
- Contributed to breaking down monolithic software into **microservice architecture** at Freightify with Node, GoLang, K8s and PHP
- Published **research** on detecting fake face images using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with an accuracy over **87.5%** - More details at [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10046797)
- Engaged in **bug bounty hunting**, earning rewards from companies like McAfee, Uber
- Implemented security measures to fix XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities at Freightify
- Developed a **social media application** for [Sri Eshwar College of Engineering](https://sece.ac.in/), used by 500+ students for college events
- Created [DataAtmos](https://dev.dataatmos.com/), a platform for managing data-related activities using Next.js and Terraform (in progress)
- Built and implemented a **network infrastructure** for [KG Hospital](https://www.kghospital.com/), a renowned hospital in [Coimbatore](https://www.google.com/search?q=coimbatore)
- Assembled and provided **custom-built computers** for 20+ individuals
- Developed a **Micro-Finance Portfolio Website** using WordPress, implementing SEO and Google My Business maintenance as my first freelance project
- Led a team of 5 members and was shortlisted to the top 50 in the **Smart India Hackathon**
- Served as **President of the Cyberspace Club** at [Sri Eshwar College of Engineering](https://sece.ac.in/) for all 4 years
- Shared knowledge on Developing and Securing Web Applications, solving challenges in HackTheBox, and Basics of Networking with hundreds of students weekly

### Some things I believe:

- **Anyone can learn anything on the internet (for free)** if they're truly passionate about it
- LLMs are super helpful, but sometimes they make me feel dumber by overdoing the assistance  
- **Open source and open research are crucial** - collective progress beats proprietary silos
- AGI is more likely to help humans than harm them, but we should build it thoughtfully
- You can't secure what you don't understand - hands-on experience beats theoretical knowledge
- **Grit > talent** - there's no substitute for putting in the hours
- **Shipping fast beats perfect strategy** - listen, build, ship, get feedback, repeat
- Being helpful compounds over time, just like good chai gets better with practice
- **Demos > lengthy documentation** - show, don't just tell
- Always assume good intent, but verify everything (trust but validate, as we say)
- Your best work comes from following genuine curiosity, not market trends
